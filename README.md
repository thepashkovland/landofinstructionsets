# landofinstructionsets
the land of arbitrary/seemingly niche code for really a few purposes only. Here, I mainly work on a console frontend known an SDECF (SDE Console Frontend) for Intel's instruction set emulator, SDE, which is found up-to-date at Intel's dev/software main page at https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html if it's not currently up to date in my release builds. More projects or repos may come soon...
