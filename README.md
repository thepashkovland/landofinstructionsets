Mainly work on a console frontend known an SDECF (SDE Console Frontend) for Intel's instruction set emulator, SDE, which is found up-to-date at Intel's dev/software main page at https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html if it's not currently up to date in my release builds.

Originally started as a modified TASKLIST for SDE, SDECF's main purpose is to be a generally easy-to-use console-based frontend for SDE meant to help those who may have difficulty using it.
